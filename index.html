                <p>I am called Wilfried Dondji and I am third year Mechanical engineering and 
                    Computer Technology student at the University of Ottawa. My interest in 
                    automated mechanical and computer systems is what attracted me to this career 
                    path and this is what I intend to do in my professional life.
                </p>
                <p>Other than the above mentioned occupations, I spend my free time either playing 
                    or watching soccer, basketball and volleyball games. I enjoy checkers and 
                    other games that tickle mt intellect. I also do freelance web-design and I am
                     currently learning Android app development.</p>

                    <h4>Ottawa, Ontario</h4>
                    <p>I am really satisfied with program so far because every semester 
                        a new question of mine is answered. I learn new stuff everyday, 
                        therefore my confidence grows. I have been most happy with the 
                        thermodynamics courses, probably because when I was starting this 
                        program, this was the only area where I felt blank.</p>

                    <p>The place where I first learned programing. Probably the first time 
                        I was that confused in a class because I had no previous experience 
                        whatsoever, but I made it through hardwork and perseverance; qualities
                         that keep me going with my program and everything in general. Now I 
                         have a good handle of java and will soon be moving to C++.</p>

                        much of our world we still do not understand and made me appreciate the 
                        progress that has been made so far.</p>

                    <p>Worked in this company as a skilled Labourer over the last two summers.
                        It was a really interesting position in terms of physical and intellectual
                        requirements. I also learned a lot about workplace teamwork since this is the only official
                        work related teamwork experience I have till date. In addition, I got to learn a little
                        about management and leadership by doing daily planning and supervision on some opportunities.

                    Different government agencies were present and provided different challenges for groups composed of four students each to find solutions to. My team worked on a challenge created by the <b>Employment and Social Development agency</b> and our solution was voted the best of all the groups working on that challenge. Overall, we ranked 6th. Below are links to the github repository used during the challenge, and the web-application we developed.<br>

                <h3>Winter 2018</h3>
                <h4>University of Ottawa, Ontario</h4>
                <p>This project was one of the requirements for the course <b>MCG 2101 - Introduction to Design.</b>In this project we were required to design and a pneumatically powered full size exoskeleton to help paramedics to their jobs individually, instead of in pairs thereby making them efficient and multiplying the coverage area while maintaining the same number of paramedics. The design was supposed to follow specific design criteria which were set by the professor. The 3D modelling software <b>SolidWorks</b> was used to model all the parts of the design. The result of my team's work can be appreciated by the following the link: <a href="./img/Final Project Assembly.PDF" target="_blank">Paramedic Exoskeleton Drawing</a></p>

                <h4>University of Ottawa, Ontario</h4>
                <p>This was the final assignment of my <b>Data Structures and Algorithms</b> course. A .cvs file was provided, which contained a list of train stations in the paris subway system, the possible links between different stations and the time each of those links took to complete. Using this data, I built a graph and using graph traversal and search algorithms, I could determine the shortest path from one station to another using as input the starting and ending station identification numbers.
